A Python-based interactive application to measure typing speed and accuracy. This project is designed to help users improve their typing skills by providing real-time speed calculations and error analysis.

Features:
Typing Speed Measurement: Calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on user input and the time taken.
Error Detection: Compares the typed text with a predefined sentence and identifies errors.
Random Sentence Generator: Selects a random sentence from a predefined list for variety.
Interactive Interface: Offers users the option to retest or exit, ensuring a seamless experience.
Command-Line Application: Lightweight and straightforward for quick usage.

How It Works:
The program selects a random sentence from a predefined list.
The user types the sentence as fast and accurately as possible.
The program calculates:
Typing Speed: Words per minute (WPM).
Errors: Number of mismatched or missing characters.
Results are displayed for the user.
